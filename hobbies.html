                <p>Don't laugh -- I'm serious. I love learning new things, and love the feeling of turning something unfamiliar into my own knowledge.</p>

                <p>Basically, I love everything about words. Thanks to the foreign language learning, I also occasionally translate novels & scripts, and make electronic books or books for printing in my spare time.</p>

                <h4 class="media-heading">Video Making</h4>
                <p>I learned to use Adobe Premiere from <a target="_blank" href="http://skyfalco.club/lrm/">Spectre Lee</a> when we worked together in the student union at Peking University. I then became the leader of the video team in the student union of the chemistry department. It was a wonderful time working with the team. </p>

                <h4 class="media-heading">Graphic Design</h4>
                <p>I also learned to use Adobe Photoshop from Spectre Lee when I was a freshman. Ever since then, I made graphic designs in others' requests from time to time.</p>

                <p>Though I haven't systematically learned drawing and are not able to draw well, I love it -- just enjoy the process, and enjoy beautiful things. I'm drawing with watercolor pencils.</p>

                <h4 class="media-heading">Volleyball &amp; Swimming</h4>
                <p>They are my favourite sports. I played volleyball as a member of the volleyball team representing the chemistry department at Peking University, where I was trained systematically the fundamental skills of volleyball. Though I was not a qualified player, I extremely enjoyed the time with the team, and I miss my teammates very much.</p>
                <p>After coming to Duke, swimming becomes my first choice. A few friends here taught me how to swim, and we went swimming together regularly before they graduated. </p>

                <p>I like watching animes, and joined a group that makes subtitles earlier this year. I think anime has an advantage over movies and TV series when expressing something abstract and exaggerated. </p>
                <p>I made a summary and review of the animes I've watched <a target="_blank" href="http://skyfalco.club/bbs/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=61">in our forum</a>. Welcome to share your thoughts on animes with me!</p>
				<p>By the way, here is <a target="_blank" href="https://space.bilibili.com/11322696/#/">my Bilibili account</a> where I've posted a few short anime-related videos I made. </p>
